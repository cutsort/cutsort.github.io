# Bio

Fred is on the Bioinformatics Research Faculty at [Carnegie Institution, Department of Embryology](https://emb.carnegiescience.edu), and an Assistant Research Professor at Johns Hopkins University, [Department of Biology](https://bio.jhu.edu).  He and his collaborators research mechanisms to effectively train and support diverse populations in genomic data science.  They focus on strategies that increase persistence among undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty.  Through collaborative educational programs, they aim to build inclusive communities that advance research using the latest genomic technologies.

<!--
This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backward compatible with initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
